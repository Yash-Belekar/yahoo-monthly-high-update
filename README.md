# yahoo-monthly-high-update
using yahoo data we find out which month has high price higher than all high prices before. Each month that breaks all high prices before has a 'NEW HIGH' value in the column B of excel sheet(Column A is month).

The py file when run will ask for stocks name (can add multiple stock names separated by commas). This will give out a csv file with column A for month and column B for 'NEW HIGH' value to show for high price breaking all older high prices. The date range for this backtest is 2000-present day. 
Have a good day.
